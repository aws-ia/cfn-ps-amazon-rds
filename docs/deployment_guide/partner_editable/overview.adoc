This guide covers the information you need to deploy Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) in the AWS Cloud.

The solution deploys a {partner-product-short-name} cluster in a private subnet with an Amazon RDS read replica in one Availability Zone and a write replica in another zone. Native replication mechanisms available with the database engine keep the read replica in sync with the source database. The deployment also includes access to Amazon CloudWatch metrics and logs, event notifications, and data encryption.

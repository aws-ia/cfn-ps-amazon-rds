image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/amazon-rds-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** An optional Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound SSH (Secure Shell) access to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances in public and private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** An {partner-product-short-name} cluster that includes a write replica in one Availability Zone and a read replica in the other.
* Amazon CloudWatch metrics for monitoring the database instance and CloudWatch logs for storing database logs.
* An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for sending CloudWatch alarm and Amazon RDS event notifications.
* AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) for encrypting the data stored in the database instance.
